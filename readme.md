<img src="app/public/images/preview2.png">

An interactive experience built with [Tensorflow.js](http://tensorflow.org/js) to demonstrate how deep neural networks (autoencoders) can be applied for the task of anomaly detection for non-time series (stationary) data.


## Gentle Introduction to Anomaly Detection

> An outlier is an observation which deviates so much from other observations as to arouse suspicions that it was generated by a different mechanism - Hawkins 1980.

Anomalies often referred to as outliers, abnormalities, rare events or deviants are data points or patterns in data that do not adhere or conform to a well-defined notion of normal behavior. Anomaly detection is therefore defined as the task of finding patterns in data that do not adhere to a well-defined notion of normal behavior. 

At the heart of most approaches to anomaly detection (and by Merlin's beard ... there are a lot), is the fundamental concept of modeling "normal behavior". Once this is achieved, we can leverage this knowledge/mechanism in assigning an anomaly score (a measure of "normalness") to new data points test time. 

> Various approaches differ on _how_ normal behavior is modelled and _how_ an anomaly score is assigned. Time series forecasting approaches tend to first forecast future values and compute an anomaly score as the difference between predictions and actual values.

Existing approaches for anomaly detection typically focus on time series data and univariate data streams (e.g. number of concurrent users of a telecoms base station over time). However, as data include more variables, it becomes more challenging to model each stream individually and aggregate results. For these situations, deep learning can be valuable. 

## Deep Learning (Using Autoencoders) for Anomaly Detection.

An Autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient (low dimensional) data representations in an unsupervised manner. It is typically comprised of two components - an encoder that learns to map input data to a low dimension representation ( also called a bottleneck, denoted by z ) and a decoder that learns to reconstruct the original signal from the low dimension representation. The training objective for the autoencoder model is to minimize the difference the reconstruction error - the difference between the input data and the reconstructed output. While autoencoder models have been widely applied for dimensionality reduction (similar to techniques such as PCA), they can also be used for anomaly detection. If we train the model on normal data (or data with very few abnormal samples), it learns a reconstruction function that works well for normal looking data (low reconstruction error) and works poorly for abnormal data (high reconstruction error). We can then use reconstruction error as a signal for anomaly detection.
In particular, if we visualize a histrogram of reconstruction errors generated by a trained autoencoder, we hopefully will observe that the distribution of errors for normal samples is overall smaller and markedly separate from the distribution of errors for abnormal data.
Note: We may not always have labelled data, but we can can assume (given the rare nature of anomalies) that the majority of data points for most anomaly detection use cases are normal. See the section below that discusses the impact of data composition (% of abnormal data) on model performance.

## Dataset

This prototype uses the ECG5000 dataset which contains 5000 examples of ECG signals from a patient. Each sample (which has been sliced into 140 points corresponding to an extracted heartbeat) has been labelled as normal or being indicative of heart conditions related to congestive heart failure - .
Data Transformation
Prior to training the autoencoder, we first apply a minmax scaling transform to the input data which converts it from its original range (2 to -5) to a range of 0 -1 This is done for two main reasons. First, existing research shows that neural networks in general train better when input values have zero mean and unit variance and lie between 0 and 1. Secondly, scaling the data supports the learning objective for the autoencoder (minimizing reconstruction error) and makes the results more interpretable. In general, the range of output values from the autoencoder is dependent on the type of activation function used in the output layer. For example, the tanh activation function outputs values in the range of -1 and 1, sigmoid outputs values in the range of 0 - 1 In the example above, we use the sigmoid activation function in the output layer of the autoencoder, allowing us directly compare the transformed input signal to the output data when computing the means square error metric during training. In addition, having both input and output in the same range allows us to visualize the differences that contribute to the anomaly classification.
Note:The parameters of the scaling transform should be computed only on train data and then applied to test data.
